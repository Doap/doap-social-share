= Are share buttons using Javascript? =

Yes. Javascript is required for sharing buttons to function properly and it must be enabled. Menu/toolbar/preview interface for share buttons is loaded at run-time from our servers so we can add minor enhancements and fix browser bugs the moment they are discovered without forcing you to upgrade the plugin all the time. Some button images are loaded from your local Wordpress installation and some from our servers. Counters load javascript code from Twitter, Facebook, Google and Linkedin.

Yes. Thay are free and will always be free. And you do not need to open any account to use them.

[Hupso Share Buttons](http://www.hupso.com/share/) provide other button types including floating toolbars. We plan to implement those in next versions of this plugin.

Please wait up to 24 hours for Facebook to fetch the new thumbnail. After that it should work.
